## TEE

Build a secure, reliable, easy-to-use, and customizable blockchain trusted computing service platform that leverages cutting-edge technologies such as blockchain, privacy protection, and secure multiparty computing to achieve absolute control over data owner ownership, while also helping Safe and efficient data cooperation between different organizations.
1) Security
The platform guarantees data transmission security, storage security, computational security and result security. That is, cryptographic means such as symmetric/asymmetric encryption, zero-knowledge proof, and attribute encryption ensure that data will not be stolen during transmission, stored data will not be lost, and the data calculation process can be traced and irreversible. Once executed, any People can't tamper with the results, and protect data computing security and result security at a deeper level;
2) Reliable
Data is available and invisible, ie data can be transmitted, calculated, stored, and verified in the platform, but the platform and any third party other than the data owner cannot obtain the original data;
3) Easy to use
Building a web-based graphical operation, management, and monitoring presentation interface, the data owner can simply upload, browse, authorize, encrypt, and combine multiple data to perform calculations, and any information that can be informatized can be Calculate or use;
4) Customizable
The calculation rules of the data can be customized by the customer, no need to restart the system, no need to change too much, once the rules are written, they can be used immediately. At the same time, the calculation rules can also be upgraded and verified.
